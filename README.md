## What is this tool?
Binart is a tool that has started as tool to detect validity in a series of binary numbers, the tool was released in the end of 2023 and since then it has been abandoned. BUT in the last few months Binart has been through a massive redesign and gained many changes and features.

3. That's it! Your binary numbers are now converted to pixels. Enjoy this tool!
4. To find the full potential of your creations, you can learn and use the plenty of the tools that Binart has to offer
## Special features
- If the colors of the binary digits don't suit you, you can change them using the change buttons below.
- If the white color hurts your eyes, you can always click on the moon and it will take care of changing the website's appearance to dark.
- The grid is designed to help measure the distance between pixels, but you can always turn it off by clicking the "Turn Grid On/Off" button
- If you have ever thought about framing your creation, you can take the first step with the help of the download button.
