# Binart changelog

> [!NOTE]
> Binart is a tool that has started as tool to detect validity in a series of binary numbers, the tool was released in the end of 2023 and since then it has been abandoned. BUT in the last few months Binart has been through a massive redesign and gained many changes and features and today we will see everything new since update 1.1.1.

# Update 2.0.0
## new features:

<details>
  <summary><b>New logo</b></summary>
  <p>as a part of his redesign, binart now has a new 3d interactive logo at the top of the page.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>Language button</b></summary>
  <p>until now, binart was only available at the Hebrew language, but now binart is also accessible to English speakers, simpely press the flag at the top to toggle between English or Hebrew, it's your choice.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>Download button</b></summary>
  <p>its a shame that you draw something so nice but can't save it right? well no more! the download button lets you to save your work in 2 formats - scaled or unscaled.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>Image to binary button</b></summary>
  <p>one of the biggest things in this update: if you are lazy like me and want to play with your existing image in binart and don't want to type number by number, use the image to binary to let the system convert each letter in your image  into a binary number. just read the rules before you use it to prevent issues.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Binart as a software</b></summary>
  <p>binart is accessible through the web, But if you want to use it without being bound to use the internet you can download the tool as a software and use it whenever you want (only for windows)</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>Secret screen?</b></summary>
  <p>never heard of it.. but some people say that by typing and converting a questionable combination binary numbers you will get a secret screen, I wonder what it has inside of it.</p>
</details>

## new features that are less important:

<details>
  <summary><b>Added a limit for the number of letters that can be entered in the text box</b></summary>
  <p>it seems that if you write a lot of letters in the textbox it can crash the site, so I added a limit of letters that can be converted, the limit is 50,000 letters, enough to paint the mona lisa, I think</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>Added savestates</b></summary>
  <p>in the past you had to press the theme button to switch into dark mode every time that you reloaded the page, now the website remembers the theme that you choose and save it until you change it.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>Added custom embed</b></summary>
  <p>if you share the website link on various social platforms like discord or twitter there will be a beautiful banner along with it</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>Added title attributes for some buttons</b></summary>
  <p>buttons that are emojis now have a title attributes on them to make it easy for those who haven't read this changelog and don't know what they're doing, just hover on them for a second and a small description about them will appear</p>
</details>

## Changes and fixes for existing features:

<details>
  <summary><b>Fixed the blank column that appears when typing space</b></summary>
  <p>the first thing that I did when I start working on 2.0 was fixing this thing, when you wrote a space at the textbox a blank column will appear and will probably ruin you art.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>GRID</b></summary>
  <p>the good old grid has been changed a lot, not only that he is not a text in a button anymore, the grid is now smarter and instead of being always red he knows exactly the color he is on and will show an inverted color of it so it will be clear to see him.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>Canvas responsivity</b></summary>
  <p>the canvas (the painting) could get out of the screen and ruin all of his design, now he is under good hands (I call it a container) which will keep him in the page all the time despite his size.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>"help" gif updated</b></summary>
  <p>the website has been through a big update and so does the gif inside the help popup to be compatible to the current website design.</p>
</details>
<details>
  <summary><b>Fixed text directions</b></summary>
  <p>as I added the English language I also made it so that when the site language is English the text direction in it will be left to right, unlike Hebrew which is a right to left language.</p>
</details>

## removed features:

<details>
  <summary><b>Reset button has been removed</b></summary>
  <p>I thought about it but after a lot of understanding, I decided to remove the reset button, it's hard for me too, the reset button was there with me from the beginning but it's important to understand that the button is useless, you can reset by just converting no text, so yeah that's the end for him.</p>
</details>

<br>
<h1>Update 1.1.1</h1>

</details>
